## 11. Security Rules & Authorization Model

### 11.1 Firestore Security Rules (`firestore.rules`)
- **Default Deny**: All unauthenticated and unmatched paths are denied access.
- **Privilege Separation**: `super_admin` operations verified through Firestore document check:
  `firestore.get(/databases/(default)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'super_admin'`.
- **Company Moderation Lock**: Employers cannot self-approve businesses or fabricate `isVerified`, `approvalStatus`, or `subscriptionPlan`.
- **Seeker Privacy Shield**: PII (phone number, full address, email) masked on public portfolio routes unless explicit access granted.

### 11.2 Storage Security Rules (`storage.rules`)
- Strict MIME validation: Images restricted to `image/*`, resumes restricted to `application/pdf`.
- File size caps: Avatars and documents capped at `< 5MB`, high-resolution banners and galleries capped at `< 10MB`.
- Company owner authorization: Logo and cover uploads enforce `isCompanyOwner(companyId) || isAdmin()`.

---

## 12. Technical SEO & Public Discovery

- **Domain Canonicalization**: Hard redirect to primary canonical domain `https://thenijobs.com` with HTTPS enforcement.
- **Dynamic Meta Tags**: OpenGraph and Twitter cards generated for all job, company, course, and marketplace routes.
- **JSON-LD Structured Data**:
  - `JobPosting` schema: Valid hiring organization, job location (Theni district/taluk), ISO 8601 validity dates.
  - `Organization` schema: Verified local businesses with geo-coordinates, telephone, and address.
  - `Course` schema: Course title, educational level, description, and provider metadata.
  - `BreadcrumbList`: Structured navigation hierarchy for Google search breadcrumbs.
- **Automated Sitemaps & Robots**:
  - `sitemap.xml`: Auto-generated dynamic index covering public hubs, taluks, and verified company pages.
  - `robots.txt`: Grants Googlebot and search indexers access to public directories while shielding `/admin/*`, `/employer/*`, `/seeker/*`, and `/api/*`.

## 14. Fixes Implemented

1. **Escaped JSX Entities**: Replaced raw quotes and apostrophes with HTML entities (`&quot;`, `&apos;`) in all affected templates.
2. **Lint Const Enforcement**: Converted un-reassigned `let` bindings to immutable `const` declarations in API routes.
3. **Memoization Dependency Normalization**: Extracted primitive `userId = user?.uid` and updated dependency arrays to satisfy React Compiler invariants.
4. **Automated Clock-Skew Compensation**: Implemented `syncClockSkew()` in [`src/lib/firebase/firebaseAdmin.ts`](file:///d:/project/thenijobs-web-main/thenijobs-web-main/src/lib/firebase/firebaseAdmin.ts) that fetches Google server headers and patches `Date.now()` and global `Date` constructor dynamically.
5. **Service Account Key Discovery**: Added multi-directory fallback resolution to locate `serviceAccountKey.json` across workspace subfolders.

3. **Urgent Hiring 48-Hour Spotlight Badge (₹99 / ₹149) (அவசர ஆட்கள் தேவை)**:

   - Animated flashing red badge displayed in public search feeds, pinned to top of homepage and taluk hubs for 48 hours.
